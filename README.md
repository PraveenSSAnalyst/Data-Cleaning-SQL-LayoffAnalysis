# Data-Cleaning-SQL---Layoff-Analysis
ðŸ”¹ The Challenge:
I worked with a Layoff Analysis dataset that contained duplicates, missing values, inconsistent formats, and unnecessary records.

ðŸ”¹ My Approach:
Using SQL, I applied several key techniques, including:

âœ… Removing duplicates 

âœ… Handling missing values

âœ… Standardizing data formats

âœ… Using staging tables to store and process intermediate cleaned data before final insertion, ensuring data integrity and rollback flexibility

ðŸ”¹ The Results:
By the end of the project, the dataset was clean, structured, and ready for analysis, improving efficiency and accuracy for downstream processes.
